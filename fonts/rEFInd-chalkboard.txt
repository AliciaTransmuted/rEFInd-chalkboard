The included rEFInd-chalkboard font (rEFInd-chalkboard) is an original hand drawn font.
Finding a suitable handwritten monospaced font, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font is challenging.
Fortunatly, it was pretty straight forward to use an existing rEFInd png font as a base for rEFInd-chalkboard.png
I recommend that you use rEFInd-chalkboard-112.png as your base file to allow for finer detailing, and then scale it down to proper width (28).
Save the editing file at 112 pixels width to retain details!!!

Feel free to use it as a base for other rEFInd theme projects.
1. Import into Gimp, Krita, Inkscape, etc.
2. Reduce opacity of original layer to about 50%.
3. Create a transparent layer above the current layer.
4. Increase magnification to about 800%.
5. Hand trace your font over the original.
   Using a tablet will, no doubt, give you cleaner results.
   I did mine with a mouse... at 800%, it's pretty easy
6. Play around with different brushes to give you different desired effects.
   e.g. chalk, felt pen, dry erase marker, etc.
   Sometimes low tech gives you exactly what you need...
